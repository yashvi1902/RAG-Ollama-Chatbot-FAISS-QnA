It was purchased in 1959, when Dr. William B. Langsdorf was appointed as founding president, the first staff was selected and plans for opening the new college were made. Orange County State College started classes for 452 full- and/or part-time students in September 1959, using leased quarters for its administrative offices on the Fullerton Union High School campus and for its classrooms at Fullerton\u2019s Sunny Hills High School. In the fall of 1960, the college opened classes on its own campus, occupying 12 temporary buildings. The name changed to Orange State College in July 1962, to California State College at Fullerton in July 1964, to California State College, Fullerton, in July 1968 and to California State University, Fullerton, in June 1972. The first permanent building, the six-story Letters and Science Building (now known as McCarthy Hall), was occupied in 1963.",

                    "Today, there co-exists an interesting mixture of the old and new lifestyles in Orange County. Underneath the soil, archaeologists and bulldozers uncover traces of the hunting and gathering Native American bands who flourished at least as early as 4,000 years ago in what was a benign and bountiful region. More visible traces remain of the Spanish and Mexican periods and cultures: Mission San Juan Capistrano, which began the agricultural tradition in Orange County, and subsequent adobes from the great land grants and ranches that followed. Additionally, both customs and many of the family names persist from this period and so does some ranching. The architecture and other evidences of the subsequent pioneer period are still quite visible: farmsteads, old buildings from the new towns that were established in the late 1800s, mining operations, and traces of early resort and other types of promotional activities. For about 100 years, farming was the main economic activity with products such as grapes, walnuts, vegetables and oranges replacing the older wheat and cattle ranches. Today, agriculture still is very important. Orange County ranks high among California\u2019s counties in mineral production with its oil, natural gas, sand, gravel and clay mining and processing activities.",

More visible traces remain of the Spanish and Mexican periods and cultures: Mission San Juan Capistrano, which began the agricultural tradition in Orange County, and subsequent adobes from the great land grants and ranches that followed. Additionally, both customs and many of the family names persist from this period and so does some ranching.

For about 100 years, farming was the main economic activity with products such as grapes, walnuts, vegetables and oranges replacing the older wheat and cattle ranches.

Orange County State College started classes for 452 full- and/or part-time students in September 1959, using leased quarters for its administrative offices on the Fullerton Union High School campus and for its classrooms at Fullerton\u2019s Sunny Hills High School.

More visible traces remain of the Spanish and Mexican periods and cultures: Mission San Juan Capistrano, which began the agricultural tradition in Orange County, and subsequent adobes from the great land grants and ranches that followed. Additionally, both customs and many of the family names persist from this period and so does some ranching. The architecture and other evidences of the subsequent pioneer period are still quite visible: farmsteads, old buildings from the new towns that were established in the late 1800s, mining operations, and traces of early resort and other types of promotional activities. For about 100 years, farming was the main economic activity with products such as grapes, walnuts, vegetables and oranges replacing the older wheat and cattle ranches.

Orange County State College started classes for 452 full- and/or part-time students in September 1959, using leased quarters for its administrative offices on the Fullerton Union High School campus and for its classrooms at Fullerton\u2019s Sunny Hills High School. In the fall of 1960, the college opened classes on its own campus, occupying 12 temporary buildings. The name changed to Orange State College in July 1962, to California State College at Fullerton in July 1964, to California State College, Fullerton, in July 1968 and to California State University, Fullerton, in June 1972.

More visible traces remain of the Spanish and Mexican periods and cultures: Mission San Juan Capistrano, which began the agricultural tradition in Orange County, and subsequent adobes from the great land grants and ranches that followed. Additionally, both customs and many of the family names persist from this period and so does some ranching. The architecture and other evidences of the subsequent pioneer period are still quite visible: farmsteads, old buildings from the new towns that were established in the late 1800s, mining operations, and traces of early resort and other types of promotional activities. For about 100 years, farming was the main economic activity with products such as grapes, walnuts, vegetables and oranges replacing the older wheat and cattle ranches.

                    "In 1957, Cal State Fullerton became the 12th State College in California to be authorized by the Legislature. The following year a site was designated in northeast Fullerton. It was purchased in 1959, when Dr. William B. Langsdorf was appointed as founding president, the first staff was selected and plans for opening the new college were made. Orange County State College started classes for 452 full- and/or part-time students in September 1959, using leased quarters for its administrative offices on the Fullerton Union High School campus and for its classrooms at Fullerton\u2019s Sunny Hills High School. In the fall of 1960, the college opened classes on its own campus, occupying 12 temporary buildings. The name changed to Orange State College in July 1962, to California State College at Fullerton in July 1964, to California State College, Fullerton, in July 1968 and to California State University, Fullerton, in June 1972. The first permanent building, the six-story Letters and Science Building (now known as McCarthy Hall), was occupied in 1963.",
                    "Today, there is dramatic evidence of additional, rapid growth. A number of new buildings have been completed, and enrollment has climbed to more than 40,000. Since 1963, the curriculum has expanded to include lower-division coursework, graduate programs \u2014 including two doctorates \u2014 as well as numerous credential and certificate programs.",
                    "The Donahoe Higher Education Act of 1960 established the California State Colleges as a system under an independent Board of Trustees, redefined the functions of the State Colleges, and related them to both the community colleges and the University of California system.",

More visible traces remain of the Spanish and Mexican periods and cultures: Mission San Juan Capistrano, which began the agricultural tradition in Orange County, and subsequent adobes from the great land grants and ranches that followed. Additionally, both customs and many of the family names persist from this period and so does some ranching. The architecture and other evidences of the subsequent pioneer period are still quite visible: farmsteads, old buildings from the new towns that were established in the late 1800s, mining operations, and traces of early resort and other types of promotional activities. For about 100 years, farming was the main economic activity with products such as grapes, walnuts, vegetables and oranges replacing the older wheat and cattle ranches.

It is now called Miles D. McCarthy Hall.",

Langsdorf Hall and the Engineering Building in 1971, the Student Health Center in 1974, the Education-Classroom Building and University Center in 1976, an addition to the Visual Arts Center in 1979, the Jewel Plummer Cobb Residence Halls and the Charles L. and Rachael E. Ruby Gerontology Center in 1988, and the Fullerton Marriott and the Computer Science Building in 1989.

The awards recognize reduced use of natural resources during construction and ongoing energy conservation efforts throughout the life of new buildings and major renovations. Water savings, sustainable site development, energy efficiency, materials selection and indoor environmental quality are among the key elements considered in the design, construction and operation of green buildings. The Student Recreation Center achieved a Gold rating from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Green Building Rating System, which is the nationally accepted benchmark. Mihaylo Hall, the Children\u2019s Center and the University Police building operate at a LEED Silver level. Most notably, the Student Housing complex achieved a rare Platinum LEED rating.",

The most recent WSCUC review took place in 2019,which granted CSUF reaffirmation for a full and maximum10-year period. To learn more, read CSUF'saccreditation history.",
                    "The WASC Senior College and University Commission (\"the Commission\") is an accrediting agency serving a diverse membership of public and private higher education institutions throughout California, Hawaii, and the Pacific as well as a limited number of institutions outside the U.S. Through its work of peer review, based on standards agreed to by the membership, the Commission encourages continuous institutional improvement, and assures the membership and its constituencies (including the public) that accredited institutions are fulfilling their missions in service to their students and the public good.",
                    "WSCUC is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as certifying institutional eligibility for federal funding in a number of programs, including student access to federal financial aid. In other words, accreditation is necessary for participation in federal and state financial aid programs. Accreditation also is important for the acceptance and transfer of college credit, is a prerequisite for student application for many graduate programs, and is often an eligibility requirement for research grant programs.",
                    "Accreditation is periodically reaffirmed through a comprehensive review process that includes an institutional self-study that results in a comprehensive Institutional Report, an external review by colleagues from peer institutions, and a site visit at least once every ten years.",
                    "CSUF\u2019s WSCUC Accreditation Liaison Officer (ALO) is Dr. Su Swarat, Senior Associate Vice President for Institutional Effectiveness and Planning. Please contact the ALO for all accreditation-related questions atalo@fullerton.edu."

                    "\u201cDuring my first year, the pandemic shutdown happened, but I didn\u2019t let that deter me. I went to a lot of club events online, and that was my little peek into what college life could be,\u201d said Wu, who was inspired to get involved with such campus organizations as Music Industry Club, Business Inter-Club Council, Entertainment & Tourism Club, the Associated Students Inc. street team, and CSUF Housing and Residential Engagement.",
                    "Wu spent over two years with the Music Industry Club, helping plan panels that featured industry professionals and artists, and serving as the club\u2019s president. He said this experience taught him the importance of interpersonal communication and how to effectively lead a team of creative individuals.",
                    "Though he was originally interested in pursuing a career in music marketing, Wu said he had ample opportunities on campus to explore his interests and find what fits him best. It was the Entertainment & Tourism Club that turned his head to film.",
                    "For almost two decades, the club has helped students network and learn from industry professionals. In addition to visiting top companies and participating in panel discussions, club members also attend various industry events, including the Critics\u2019 Choice Awards, the Golden Globes and more.",
                    "Wu, who served as marketing director for the club, carried this experience into his first internship as a creative content intern for Paramount Pictures, where he developed a marketing campaign project, brainstormed content promotion for upcoming projects and worked on such films as \u201cSmile,\u201d \u201cDungeons & Dragons\u201d and \u201cSonic 2.\u201d",
                    "\u201cMingyu has proven himself both inside the classroom as an outstanding student and through his many ventures as a student organization leader and volunteer in activities on and off our campus,\u201d said Waleed Rashidi, associate professor of communications and adviser for the Entertainment & Tourism Club.",
                    "After completing his first internship with Paramount, Wu went on to work as a tour marketing intern for Live Nation Entertainment and a global talent development and inclusion intern forNBCUniversalbefore returning to Paramount as a digital marketing intern his senior year. For his excellence in marketing and creativity, Paramount Pictures nominated Wu for Academy Gold, a talent development program hosted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.",
                    "\u201cI think my internship experiences really helped me land my first full-time role with Paramount Pictures,\u201d said Wu. \u201cI also have a lot of appreciation for my classes, professors and campus activities because they played a huge role in shaping my professional journey.\u201d"
