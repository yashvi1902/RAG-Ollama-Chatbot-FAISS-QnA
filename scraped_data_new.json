It was purchased in 1959, when Dr. William B. Langsdorf was appointed as founding president, the first staff was selected and plans for opening the new college were made. Orange County State College started classes for 452 full- and/or part-time students in September 1959, using leased quarters for its administrative offices on the Fullerton Union High School campus and for its classrooms at Fullerton\u2019s Sunny Hills High School. In the fall of 1960, the college opened classes on its own campus, occupying 12 temporary buildings. The name changed to Orange State College in July 1962, to California State College at Fullerton in July 1964, to California State College, Fullerton, in July 1968 and to California State University, Fullerton, in June 1972. The first permanent building, the six-story Letters and Science Building (now known as McCarthy Hall), was occupied in 1963.",

Orange County has more than doubled its population over the last four decades, and it will continue to grow in the decades to come.",
                    "Today, there co-exists an interesting mixture of the old and new lifestyles in Orange County. Underneath the soil, archaeologists and bulldozers uncover traces of the hunting and gathering Native American bands who flourished at least as early as 4,000 years ago in what was a benign and bountiful region. More visible traces remain of the Spanish and Mexican periods and cultures: Mission San Juan Capistrano, which began the agricultural tradition in Orange County, and subsequent adobes from the great land grants and ranches that followed. Additionally, both customs and many of the family names persist from this period and so does some ranching. The architecture and other evidences of the subsequent pioneer period are still quite visible: farmsteads, old buildings from the new towns that were established in the late 1800s, mining operations, and traces of early resort and other types of promotional activities. For about 100 years, farming was the main economic activity with products such as grapes, walnuts, vegetables and oranges replacing the older wheat and cattle ranches. Today, agriculture still is very important. Orange County ranks high among California\u2019s counties in mineral production with its oil, natural gas, sand, gravel and clay mining and processing activities.",

                    "California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) was initially accredited byWestern Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) - Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC)in 1961. The most recent WSCUC review took place in 2019,which granted CSUF reaffirmation for a full and maximum10-year period.\u00a0To learn more, read CSUF'saccreditation history.",
                    "The WASC Senior College and University Commission (\"the Commission\") is an accrediting agency serving a diverse membership of public and private higher education institutions throughout California, Hawaii, and the Pacific as well as a limited number of institutions outside the U.S. Through its work of peer review, based on standards agreed to by the membership, the Commission encourages continuous institutional improvement, and assures the membership and its constituencies (including the public) that accredited institutions are fulfilling their missions in service to their students and the public good.",
                    "WSCUC is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as certifying institutional eligibility for federal funding in a number of programs, including student access to federal financial aid. In other words, accreditation is necessary for participation in federal and state financial aid programs. Accreditation also is important for the acceptance and transfer of college credit, is a prerequisite for student application for many graduate programs, and is often an eligibility requirement for research grant programs.",
                    "Accreditation is periodically reaffirmed through a comprehensive review process that includes an institutional self-study that results in a comprehensive Institutional Report, an external review by colleagues from peer institutions, and a site visit at least once every ten years.",
                    "CSUF\u2019s WSCUC Accreditation Liaison Officer (ALO) is Dr. Su Swarat, Senior Associate Vice President for Institutional Effectiveness and Planning. Please contact the ALO for all accreditation-related questions atalo@fullerton.edu."

                    "\u201cDuring my first year, the pandemic shutdown happened, but I didn\u2019t let that deter me. I went to a lot of club events online, and that was my little peek into what college life could be,\u201d said Wu, who was inspired to get involved with such campus organizations as Music Industry Club, Business Inter-Club Council, Entertainment & Tourism Club, the Associated Students Inc. street team, and CSUF Housing and Residential Engagement.",

He said this experience taught him the importance of interpersonal communication and how to effectively lead a team of creative individuals.",

                    "Though he was originally interested in pursuing a career in music marketing, Wu said he had ample opportunities on campus to explore his interests and find what fits him best. It was the Entertainment & Tourism Club that turned his head to film.",
                    "For almost two decades, the club has helped students network and learn from industry professionals. In addition to visiting top companies and participating in panel discussions, club members also attend various industry events, including the Critics\u2019 Choice Awards, the Golden Globes and more.",
                    "Wu, who served as marketing director for the club, carried this experience into his first internship as a creative content intern for Paramount Pictures, where he developed a marketing campaign project, brainstormed content promotion for upcoming projects and worked on such films as \u201cSmile,\u201d \u201cDungeons & Dragons\u201d and \u201cSonic 2.\u201d",

For his excellence in marketing and creativity, Paramount Pictures nominated Wu for Academy Gold, a talent development program hosted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.",
                    "\u201cI think my internship experiences really helped me land my first full-time role with Paramount Pictures,\u201d said Wu. \u201cI also have a lot of appreciation for my classes, professors and campus activities because they played a huge role in shaping my professional journey.\u201d"
